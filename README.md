# Bionic-Pump
simulation of basic workings of an Artificial Pancreas


Running prototype of a Bionic Pump (Artificial Pancreas)
Interface design in **JavaFX**
Implementation using **Java**


**Aim: to maintain a normal blood sugar level, by injecting hormones (Insulin OR Glucagon)**


**Description:**
Automatic mode of simulation, that tries to keep blood sugar within normal limits, 
by automatically calculating hormone dosage and injecting the same into patient.
Based on the injected dose and some mathematical calculations, Blood Sugar is brought down to normal range.
Manual intervention in this prototype, involves only adding or subtracting some fixed units of carbohydrates;
based on which sugar level drops or rises.


A detailed **report(*\*.pdf*)** and **basic workflow(*\*.jpg*)** of the pump is also attached as a part of this repository.

Also attached a **small video(*\*.mp4*)** of the running code.
